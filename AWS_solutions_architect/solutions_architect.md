### Overview of AWS

#### The History of AWS

- Why is AWS so powerful? 
  - Amazon allows companies to use Amazon's Web Servers(AWS) without risks associated with having to build home-grown servers. This allows for companies with tighter budgets to build into AWS and leverage all the integrated server scalability features that Amazon provides. Additionally, it reduces risks to the company because they no longer have to manage and maintain their own server farm.

- In 2003, Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper on what Amazons internal infrastructure could look like. They suggested selling it as a service and prepared a business case for it. 

- SQS was launched in 2004, the very first service released by AWS.

- AWS was a business launched in 2006, targeting developers in Silicon Valley.

- By 2007, AWS had over 180,000 developers on the platform.
